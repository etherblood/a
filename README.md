# Ethercards
Simplistic card game, mostly inspired by magic and hearthstone

It currently expects an authentication-token to be passed as argument by the destrostudios launcher.
Demo can be played after downloading & installing the launcher: https://github.com/destrostudios/launcher

Alternatively it is also possible to pass your own JWT after replacing https://github.com/etherblood/a/blob/master/public.pem with your public key, see https://github.com/etherblood/a/tree/master/network-api/src/main/java/com/etherblood/a/network/api/jwt .
